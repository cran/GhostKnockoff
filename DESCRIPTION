Description: Functions for multiple knockoff inference using summary statistics, e.g. Z-scores. The knockoff inference is a general procedure for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) when performing variable selection. This package provides a procedure which performs knockoff inference without ever constructing individual knockoffs (GhostKnockoff). It additionally supports multiple knockoff inference for improved stability and reproducibility. Moreover, it supports meta-analysis of multiple overlapping studies.
